# Development Plan (Updated 2025-02-08)

- Maintain a predictable build pipeline (npm install, npm run build) with API_KEY configured via .env.
- Extend kinetic core to fuse rhythm (bass) and atmosphere (mid/high) so character moves track percussion while still reacting to tonal motion.
- Keep the holographic visualizer in lockstep via shared cues but bias it toward atmospheric color/morph changes and camera sweeps.
- Log every work session in `DEVLOG.md` with date/time, scope, and testing status.
- Layer in orbital overlays and negative/stripe flashes triggered by drops/fills, validating both predictive (lookahead) and reactive (stutter) paths with canvas snapshot checks before builds.
