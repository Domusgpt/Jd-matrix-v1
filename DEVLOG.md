- Fused rhythm and atmosphere cues so dancer and hologram share timing while keeping their own emphases.
- Added predictive camera/hologram sweeps tied to bass drops and atmospheric swells.
- Documented plan in `DEV_PLAN.md` and kept lookahead-based mappings aligned with kinetic sequencing.
- Testing: `npm run build` (pass).

- Added orbital strip overlays and drop-triggered negative/stripe flashes to keep camera sweeps synchronized with atmospheric lift.
- Blended stutter/drop cues into shared deck orbitals so bass-driven moves still borrow atmospheric energy.
- Testing: `npm run build`.
